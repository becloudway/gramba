# Gramba

Gramba, is a *for now* experimental library that acts as a small interface for AWS Lambda native compiled projects.
It's mostly a toolset with a small runtime that can be added to a regular lambda to act as a bridge between AWS
standard Java lambdas and the AWS Lambda Runtime API.

It relies fully on the awesome GraalVM project which can be found [here](https://www.graalvm.org/)
And seeks to make native compiling easier for AWS Lambda!

## Work in progress

We are working towards a release, so this readme will be futher completed along with a blogpost. That is a follow up of 
the previous blogpost that can be found on [medium](https://medium.com/cloudway/gramba-a-graalvm-native-image-runtime-and-toolchain-for-aws-lambda-
) or our [website](https://www.cloudway.be/en/blog/gramba-graalvm-native-image-runtime-and-toolchain-aws-lambda)
